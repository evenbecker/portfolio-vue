## Intro

Linux works well on server. However on desktop, there are more things to consider: multimedia codecs, Wi-Fi
drivers, GPU drivers (possible screen tearing/stuttering/flickering), CPU microcode, printers drivers, ...
Problems may happen. Never expect popular distros to make things work out-of-the-box as they pretend to do.
Better study the configuration files and CLI utilities by reading the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) or the Gentoo wiki. A good Linux user doesn't need GUI system configuration tools besides the installer.

## Thoughs on security

Opinions about bloat are divided. Security
experts think that complex software is prone to vulnerabilities. Some pieces of software contain tremendous
amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices. In addition, new features can
increase the attack surface and introduce a large amount of new bugs. More infos at my <a href="https://init-freedom.netlify.app/">website about init freedom</a>.

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html">FSF-approved</a> Trisquel GNU/Linux gives a good idea
about what to avoid. Trisquel doesn't have a Gnome edition, so I don't use Gnome. I use IceWM: a stacking window
manager. One big advantage of window managers is to be able to run apps of different desktop environments
without any stability/performance loss.
I use MouseWinTabbing to merge windows and form a tab. This feature was originally developped for Haiku and
later implemented in IceWM.
Here are some of the tools I use:

My favorite distro is [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/). This distro is praised for its speed, small attack surface,
and flexibility.

For maximum security, I install my dev tools on a secondary OS in dual-boot. Indeed these tools have
vulnerabilities. For instance, there are more and more malicious VS Code extensions. Most people avoid dual
booting because it is time consuming. Here is a
summary of my dual-boot setup:

## My opinion on some Linux distros

**Ubuntu:** Too much bloat preinstalled. Snap has terrible bloat. Telemetry
is probably increasing. Some Ubuntu derivatives don't come with Snap: Bodhi Linux, Pop!\_OS and Linux Mint for
example. It may change.

**Fedora Workstation :** A user-friendly net installer called 'Everything
installer' is available since 2025. Fedora has a strict policy of including only open source software in its
official repositories... but there is a lot of non-free firmware/drivers preinstalled. Fedora is therefore not
FSF-approved. There is also telemetry since Fedora 42.

**Silverblue/Kinoite:** minimalistic but it's not suitable for everybody because updates are delivered
as full images. That's time consuming and disk space consuming. Flatpak apps are recommended to keep the image
small, but Flatpak apps have more issues (bugs and audio or storage permissions problems). Here is a quote from
a devs chat: <q>Flatpak doesn’t allow important parts of the Chromium sandbox to work as it should. Chromium
browsers and Electron apps distributed on Flathub all rely on a 3rd-party package called Zypak to trick
Chromium into thinking its SUID sandbox is present.
</q>

**Manjaro :** Unsigned packages from time to time. More and more bloat and
telemetry. I strongly recommend Manjaro users to switch to KaOS or PCLinuxOS which are saner stable rolling distro.

**Debian :** No bloat but outdated software, especially browsers. No graphical
minimal installer, only a CLI installer. Some Debian derivatives have a graphical minimal installer, namely
PeppermintOS and Q4OS.

**Debian testing:** The debian testing branch can move very fast and many users have broken their
system. Security patches are not immediately available. The unstable branch is more secure.

**MX Linux :** Not so bloated. Latest firefox available. It's like Debian++ to
me. Very good distro.

**OpenSUSE Tumbleweed :** Zypper is slower and less reliable than dnf. Many
Tumbleweed users have to use Flatpak because OpenSUSE multimedia codec repos are messy and can lead to
dependencies issues. Packman repo is maintained by external people who don't follow SUSE policy. Some Packman
RPMs might be malicious.

**Arch Linux :** No bloat. Bleeding edge, so unstability might come from update
to update, namely broken glibc and kernel panic at boot. It's generally fixed after 2-3 days. Tip: dual-boot
Arch with a stable rescue distro to remain operational during these days.

**KaOS :** No bloat, user-friendly, more stable than Arch Linux. Downside: it's
only for KDE users, no kernels choice, limited software choice. However its clean and lean packages dependencies makes KaOS superior to Manjaro KDE edition.

**Void Linux:** No bloat, more stable than Arch Linux. The xbps tools are
amazing. Use xbps-src and git to locally install/update packages like Brave browser. Very good distro.

**Gentoo :** Source-based distro, no bloat, more stable than Arch Linux. It
takes time to build packages. Better use Gentoo with a window manager like icewm to build quickly. Not suitable
for users who need to quickly install big software like libreoffice and chromium.

**PCLinuxOS :** A minimal KDE edition is available. It's a very stable rolling distro.
