To develop and build this website, I have considered two TypeScript-compatible Static Site Generators: VuePress 2 and Astro. I discovered Astro when I participated to documentation writting for the [KaOS](https://kaosx.us/) project in 2024. I have chosen VuePress 2 because I have experience in Vue.JS and I was immediately impressed by the fine customization possibilities and the available theming options. I have extended the Gungnir theme to create a custom 'About me' section. I was able to write SCSS files and Vue components. Such customization is not possible with other SSGs such as Eleventy or Jekyll.
